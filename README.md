📦 N8N Workflows Repository

This repository contains exported n8n workflows (JSON format) that you can import into your own n8n automation instance.

📋 What’s Here

My_workflow_5.json — An n8n workflow you can import and run in your n8n workspace.
(Expand this description once you add details about what the workflow does.)

🚀 About n8n

n8n is a fair-code workflow automation tool. Workflows are represented as JSON files that you can import directly into n8n to automate tasks across systems.

📥 How to Use These Workflows

1. Open your n8n instance — either hosted or local.
2. Go to “Workflows” in the left sidebar.
3. Click Import (or paste JSON directly onto the canvas).
4. Open My_workflow_5.json in your browser/editor and copy its contents.
5. Paste into the n8n canvas or use the import option.
6. Configure credentials & settings — most workflows contain placeholders you must replace with your own API keys, account IDs, webhook URLs, etc.
7. Save and activate the workflow.

Example: if your workflow calls a Telegram API or an OpenAI node, you’ll need to create corresponding credentials in n8n and fill them in before the workflow can run.

🛠 Want to Add More Workflows?

Feel free to add additional .json workflow exports to this repo:
1. Export workflows from your n8n instance (click on a workflow → Export).
2. Add them to the repo in a new folder like /workflows.
3. Update this README with the workflow list + descriptions.

❗ Tips for Better Documentation

A good README typically includes:
1. What the project does (e.g., what this workflow automates).
2. Dependencies or prerequisites (API keys, services).
3. How to configure the workflow after import.
4. Screenshots or example runs if possible.
